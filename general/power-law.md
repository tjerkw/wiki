The power law describes a common phenomenon in which small changes can have disproportionate results.

The power law is at the root of the [Peter Principle](./peter-principle.md), and of compounding interest.

# Power law of Venture Capital

(From Peter Thiel)

The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.

This implies two very strange rules for VCs.  First, only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund.  This is a scary rule, because it eliminates the vast majority of possible investments. (Even quite successful companies usually succeed on a more humble scale.)  This leads to rule number two: because rule number one is so restrictive, there canâ€™t be any other rules.
