# Tools are Not Goals

When you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

When you are good with a certain tool, you want to apply it everywhere. Because that's what you know.
But be open, and learn about the problem and context. And see what tool fits best, even if you're not familiar with the tool or programming language.
