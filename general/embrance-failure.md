# Embrace Failure

Failing feels bad, people try to avoid it.
But, failure is a critical component to learning, to progress.
The only way to learn is to fail. Failing often means you learn.

Progress is accelarated when not being afraid to fail.
Embracing & celebrating failur leads to progress.

Life becomes a lot more fun, and less heavy when you view failure as part of it.

Side note: Off course you should try to learn from failures, and try to learn something everytime.
