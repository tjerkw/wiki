# Embrace Failure

Failing feels bad, people try to avoid it.
But, failure is a critical component to learning, to progress.
The only way to learn is to fail. Failing often means you learn.

Progress is accelarated when not being afraid to fail.
Embracing & celebrating failur leads to progress.

Life becomes a lot more fun, and less heavy when you view failure as part of it.

Side note: Off course you should try to learn from failures, and try to learn something everytime.

In combination with the [Power Law](./power-law.md) and the [Pareto Principle](./pareto-principle.md) its clear why failing is necessary: You need to try hard enough to find the 20% that does work, so 80% of the time you will fail. That 20% will grow very big due to the power law.
