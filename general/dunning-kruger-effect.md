# Dunning-Kruger Effect

The Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. 

This is very much related to the imposter syndrome.
