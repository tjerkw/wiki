# Input Driven

Most people are output driven, they are set-back or motivated by their results / outputs.

But outputs are not always in your control.. Inputs are.

You can decide how often you go to the gym, how much time you spend with your partner, how many hours you put into the project.

If you focus on your inputs, and be proud of your inputs, you're more stable.

Outputs might come, but they might also fail. Which is fine. At least you're proud of being part of the input given.

This related to the power law, and pareto principle. 20% of your input is responsible to 80% of the ouput. So dont be sad about he other 80% of the input. Be proud of it. You cant be the one person that always is succesfull.
