Richer get richer, poorer get poorer.

A scientist that already has a lot of publications gets an award more easy.

An app with lots of downloads, is higher ranked and therefore gets even more downloads.

This is often due to compound "interest". Both economically, as well as socially. (Being in the news increases chances to get richer)


The Matthew effect of accumulated advantage, Matthew principle, or Matthew effect for short, is sometimes summarized by the adage "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer".[1][2] The concept is applicable to matters of fame or status, but may also be applied literally to cumulative advantage of economic capital. In the beginning, Matthew effects were primarily focused on the inequality in the way scientists were recognized for their work. However, Norman W. Storer, of Columbia University, led a new wave of research. He believed he discovered that the inequality that existed in the social sciences also existed in other institutions.[3]
